*****Destroy Any Dressers and End Tables Before Adding To An Existing Game*****

Dressers and end tables are now storage. By default, they hold non-tainted apparel. They can  be configured to store weapons, drugs, and textiles. To compensate, their beauty is reduced to 3 for dressers and 2 for end tables.

Integrates Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Core and Spacer
Integrates [Tate's Tiny Furniture](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/itemedittext/?id=2247819099)

Integrated With Deep Storage

[LWM's Deep Storage](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/itemedittext/?id=1617282896) is highly recommend, as it will cause items will be stored inside the dressers and end tables instead of on top. With deep storage, capacity is:


- End Tables - Max 4 light-weight items.
- Dressers - Max 8 shirts or 4 parkas, can't hold power armor.
- Wardrobe (Vanilla Furniture Expanded) - Max 16 shirts or 8 parkas or 2 power armor.
